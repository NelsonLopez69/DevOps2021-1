#ignore all JENKINS_HOME except jobs directory, root xml config, and .gitignore file
!/jobs
!/.gitignore
!/*.xml

#ignore all files in jobs subdirectories except for folders
#note: git doesn't track folders, only file content
jobs/**
!jobs/**/

#uncomment the following line to save next build numbers with config
#!jobs/**/nextBuildNumber

#exclude only config.xml files in repository subdirectories
!config.xml

#don't track workspaces (when users build on the master)
jobs/**/*workspace

#as a result only settings and job config.xml files in JENKINS_HOME will be tracked by git


# Local .terraform directories
.terraform/*

# .tfstate files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log

# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run. Most
# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.
#
# example.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*
